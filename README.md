# Amazon_Vine_Analysis:
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We had access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. We picked  one of these datasets, [video game](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz). We used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transformed the data, connected to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, we used Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, youâ€™ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
